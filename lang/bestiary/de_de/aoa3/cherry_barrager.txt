Seemingly an older cousin of the Cherry Blaster, the barrager actually appears to be the same creature at a later stage of life.
This detail hasn't yet been confirmed scientifically, but field observations seem to point at this being the case.

Much like the blaster, the barrager is aggressive and fires volatile projectiles at passers-by.
In general it is advised to avoid coming too close to one at all costs.
